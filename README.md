# Insurance Customer EDA Project

This project analyzes an insurance customer dataset using R.  
It includes data exploration, visualization, summary statistics, and insights relevant for understanding customer behavior and insurance interest.


## Project Overview

- **Goal:** Explore customer patterns and risk factors
- **Tools:** R, dplyr, base plotting
- **Dataset size:** 1,000 customer records
- **Main tasks:**
  - Summary statistics
  - Histograms, boxplots, scatterplots
  - Filtering and indexing analysis
  - Business insights


## Files in this Repository

- `train.csv` – insurance customer dataset  
- `Insurance_EDA_NhiTran.R` – full R script for the analysis  
- `scatter_murder_population.png` – scatterplot example  
- `hist_murder_rate.png` – histogram of murder rate  
- `boxplot_murder_rate.png` – boxplot of murder rate  
- `insights.md` (or `.txt`) – written insights and conclusions  


## Key Findings (Summary)

1. Murder rate distribution is strongly right-skewed.
2. Most states have a murder rate below 4 per 100,000.
3. A few states act as high outliers and pull up the national average.
4. Population size is positively correlated with total murders.
5. The customer base is mostly middle-aged with moderate vintage.
6. Around half of customers show interest in insurance.
7. Customers with previous vehicle damage behave differently from those without.
8. Some customer segments appear more likely to purchase insurance.
